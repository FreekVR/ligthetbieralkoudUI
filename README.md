## Getting Started

#### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and AngularJS framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the AngularJS code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the AngularJS framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
material-start changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes
it easier to serve the files by a web server.*

### Run End-to-End Tests

To run your e2e tests your should install and configure Protractor and the Selenium WebServer.
These are already specified as npm dependencies within `package.json`. Simply run these
terminal commands:

```console
npm update
webdriver-manager update
```

Your can read more details about Protractor and e2e here: http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/
for more details on Protractor.

 1. Start your local HTTP Webserver: `live-server` or `http-server`.

```console
cd ./app; live-server;
```

> Note: since `live-server` is working on port 8080, we configure the `protractor.conf.js` to use
`baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080'`

 2. In another tab, start a Webdriver instance:
 
```console
webdriver-manager start
```

>This will start up a Selenium Server and will output a bunch of info logs. Your Protractor test
will send requests to this server to control a local browser. You can see information about the
status of the server at `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`. If you see errors, verify path in
`e2e-tests/protractor.conf.js` for `chromeDriver` and `seleniumServerJar` to your local file system.

 3. Run your e2e tests using the `test` script defined in `package.json`:
 
```console
npm test
```

> This uses the local **Protractor** installed at `./node_modules/protractor`

## Directory Layout

```
app/                    --> all of the source files for the application
  assets/app.css        --> default stylesheet
  src/           --> all app specific modules
     users/              --> package for user features
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
karma.conf.js         --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
e2e-tests/            --> end-to-end tests
  protractor-conf.js    --> Protractor config file
  scenarios.js          --> end-to-end scenarios to be run by Protractor
```

## Updating Angular

Previously we recommended that you merge in changes to angular-seed into your own fork of the
project. Now that the AngularJS framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers
(npm and bower) you can use these tools instead to update the dependencies.

You can update the tool dependencies by running:

```
npm update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` file.

You can update the Angular dependencies by running:

```
bower update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `bower.json` file.


## Serving the Application Files

While AngularJS is client-side-only technology and it's possible to create AngularJS webapps that
don't require a backend server at all, we recommend serving the project files using a local
web server during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The
sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, xhr,
etc to function properly when an html page is opened via `file://` scheme instead of `http://`.

### Running the App during Development

The angular-seed project comes pre-configured with a local development web server.  It is a node.js
tool called [http-server][http-server].  You can install http-server globally:

```
sudo npm install -g live-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running:

```
cd app
live-server
```

Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own webserver, such as apache or nginx. Just
configure your server to serve the files under the `app/` directory.
